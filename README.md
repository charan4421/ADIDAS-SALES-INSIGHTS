******Adidas Sales Analysis Dashboard (Power BI + Python + Machine Learning)******
***This project presents an interactive sales analysis dashboard for Adidas, visualized in Power BI.
It provides comprehensive insights into Adidas' sales performance across various dimensions such as time, regions, products, and retailers.
The dashboard integrates Python scripts for data preprocessing and leverages machine learning techniques for sales prediction and optimization*****.

Machine Learning Integration

To provide advanced insights and predictive capabilities:

Predictive Sales Model: Using historical sales data, a machine learning model was built in Python to predict future sales trends.

Optimization: The model can forecast sales per product and region to optimize stock levels, pricing strategies, and marketing efforts.

**Tools & Technologies**

Power BI: For data visualization and dashboard creation.

Python: Used for data wrangling, preprocessing, and integrating machine learning models.

Scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms for sales prediction.

Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and analysis.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization in Python.

**Data Insights**

1. Seasonality Impact: The sales trend demonstrates clear seasonality, with peaks during summer months, likely due to increased sports activities and events.


2. Geographical Strength: The West and Midwest regions dominate the sales, suggesting the need for targeted marketing in other underperforming regions.


3. Retailer Strategy: West Gear and Foot Locker outperform other retailers, highlighting key partnerships. Lower performance from online platforms like Amazon suggests potential areas for growth in digital sales.


4. Product Focus: Menâ€™s Street Footwear is the best-selling category, indicating high demand in this segment. The insights can inform future product development and marketing campaigns.
